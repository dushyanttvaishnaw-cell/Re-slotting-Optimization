# Re-slotting-Optimization
Executed re slotting optimization for DHL’s Unilever site by reorganizing SKUs based on velocity, cube, and order history. Shifted high movers to prime pick zones, redistributed slow movers, and reduced travel time. Improved pick rates, cut labor hours, and increased overall throughput.
